# CTF Training
## Q&A Sessions
Bring a list of concepts/questions that you do not understand to the group. The group works together to come up with a resolution.
If the group can't explain, we work as a group leveraging AI, Google, and other tools to find the answer.
## In-person Trainings
Your goal should be to have fun at practice and get to know eachother, learning is just a side effect. 
Save the grinding for when you are practicing remotely.
