          <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Our goal is to create an inclusive, engaging, and respectful environment for all ECPI
            Greensboro students participating in cybersecurity-related student activities and organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We welcome individuals from all backgrounds and experiences. Everyone deserves a friendly, safe,
            and professional space to collaborate, learn, and grow—regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
            ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for all participants and the actions that will be
            taken if those expectations are violated.

          <h2>2. Community Principles</h2>
          <p>
            Cybersecurity is built on trust, integrity, and teamwork. We encourage every participant to
            contribute to a positive, collaborative community and to recognize that our actions impact those
            around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you see someone promoting inclusivity, offering support, or helping others succeed—acknowledge
            and encourage them. If you observe behavior that harms our community, report it promptly to an advisor.
          </p>
