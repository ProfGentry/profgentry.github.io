# Capture The Flag (CTF) Team Information
## What is CTF?
CTF is a competitive, hands-on cybersecurity challenge where students act like real-world hackers—ethically, of course. The goal is to solve puzzles, exploit vulnerabilities, or defend systems to “capture” digital flags—small bits of hidden data that prove you’ve completed a challenge.

CTFs are intense, creative, and wildly educational. They help you think like both an attacker and a defender, sharpening problem-solving, teamwork, and real-world technical skills. You don’t need to be an expert to start—just curious, persistent, and ready to learn.

If you want to meet sharp minds, test your limits, and feel the adrenaline of digital combat (without breaking any laws), CTFs are your arena.

## Who is CTF for?
First things first, nobody is expecting you to be CTF expert right out of th gate. Everyone starts somewhere, and that “somewhere” is usually full of curiosity, not credentials. Don’t let inexperience or uncertainty hold you back.

The truth is, the most valuable person on any team isn’t always the one racking up points—it’s the one who brings people together, sparks energy, and keeps momentum alive. That’s leadership in its purest form. You can be a total n00b or a seasoned wizard; what matters most is your drive to learn and your willingness to take the first step. The rest will come.

And if that little voice starts whispering, “I don’t know enough, no one will listen,” silence it. You’re not in this alone. The ECPI community has your back every step of the way. We’ll help you learn, grow, and discover what you’re capable of, together.
