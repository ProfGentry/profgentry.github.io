# ECPI University Greensboro Campus – Capture the Flag Student Activities Code of Conduct
## 1. Purpose

Our goal is to create an inclusive, engaging, and respectful environment for all ECPI Greensboro students participating in cybersecurity-related student activities and organizations. 
We welcome individuals from all backgrounds and experiences. 
Everyone deserves a friendly, safe, and professional space to collaborate, learn, and grow—regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion.

This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for all participants and the actions that will be taken if those expectations are violated.

## 2. Community Principles

Cybersecurity is built on trust, integrity, and teamwork. 
We encourage every participant to contribute to a positive, collaborative community and to recognize that our actions impact those around us.

If you see someone promoting inclusivity, offering support, or helping others succeed—acknowledge and encourage them.
