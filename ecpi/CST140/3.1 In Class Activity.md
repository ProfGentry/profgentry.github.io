# Week 3: Security Updates
## General Information
To implement real-world security solutions 

You will need: 
- Access to VMWare software, with Windows 10 VM already installed, with username with administrator privileges. This was a seat-specific installation completed in an earlier lesson (1.2). 
Both sites will be referred to as VM Windows10.
- Access to LabSim TestOut PCPro 7.0 via student account for Part 2. For Part 2, the correlating items on TestOut PcPro 7.0 are: 
  - 8.5.1 "Updates"
  - 8.5.2 "Use Windows Update"
  - 8.5.3 "Update Facts"
  - 8.5.4 "Configure Windows Update"

## Instructions
Follow the instructions below to complete this lab, which is in two parts. 
Take cropped screenshots when indicated and save them in in the Deliverables section of this report. 
Submit these instructions and your screenshots as your report file. 

There are four required screenshots in this lab; place them in the correct order and location for full credit. 

## Part 1:  Networks and Windows Defender in VM Windows10
1. Log in to your VM Windows10 using your studentID account (VMWare).
   - This must be an account with administrative rights.  

2. Change the name of the VM Windows10 to be “PC1-6studentid”, replacing “studentID” with the six letters of your student ID in lowercase (example, PC1-johsmi). 

    - There are two ways to change the name; we will use PowerShell to accomplish this task.
    - In the “search box” type in PowerShell, then right-click the “Windows PowerShell Desktop app” that appears and choose “Run as administrator”. (Confirm it is the correct PowerShell, not “ISE”).
    - Answer “yes” to the UAC question and PowerShell opens. 

3. Type in rename-computer -NewName “PC1-studentid” (first six letters of your student id, such as johsmi) and hit Enter. 

    - The syntax has to be exact, including spaces and quotation marks.
    - If you get an error message, confirm you chose Run as asministrator and check for syntax.
    - Here is a sample of the commands, using John Smith as the name

**SCREENSHOT 1: Take an image of your PowerShell “rename” command before you reboot.**

    - Then type in shutdown /r /t 05 and press Enter; this will restart your VM Windows10 in 5 seconds. 
    - A restart is necessary when changing the host name of a Windows computer.

**Screenshot 1: place it with the label under “Deliverables”, at the end of this report.**

4. Confirm your computer has been properly renamed: right-click the Start Menu and choose “System” and you will see the computer name in your System Properties box. (Note: the “Change settings” is another way to change the computer name. Both methods require you to reboot the system for the change to take place.) 

    - You can also see the computer name by typing whoami in the command line interface. 
    - The whoami is a useful command to provide any screenshot with your “signature”. 

5. Open the Command line interface with administrative rights by right clicking the Start Menu and choosing “Command Prompt (Admin)”. 

    - Note: Administrative rights is also known as “elevated privileges”.
    - The command line will have a black background with white letters.
    - Change this to a white background with black letters by typing in COLOR F0 and press Enter (That is a zero after the “F”).
    - Keep this command line open for the next few steps. 

6. In the command line interface, type firewall.cpl and press Enter to open the Windows Firewall configuration. 
    - Turn off the Windows Firewall for both private and public networks.
    - (Note: Discuss in class the pros and cons of turning off the firewall, and note that many antivirus software turn off the Windows firewall). 

7. Open Windows Defender (enter Defender in the Search box and choose “Run as Administrator”).  
    - Verify that Real-time protection is on and that Virus and spyware definitions are up to date.
    - Perform a quick scan of your system with Windows Defender by clicking Scan Now.
    - Click the Update tab to see the results and time and date of the last “Definitions Update”. 

8. Click on the “Update” tab in Windows Defender and place a screenshot here of the results of the last Defender update. 
    - Note that this is NOT the same as doing a Window Update!
      
**Screenshot 2: place it with the label under “Deliverables”.**

9. Type ipconfig /all and press Enter to see your computer’s network setup. 
    - Then scroll up so that you can see your new computer name and your IP address.
    - Take a screenshot that includes your computer name, your IP address, and the network information through and including the Default Gateway of your main Ethernet Adapter (your instructor can assist and confirm that you are getting it correctly).
    - You may have to adjust the screen or font size to get all this information into one legible screenshot. 

**Screenshot 3: place it with the label under “Deliverables”.**

## Part 2: Windows Updates in the LabSim TestOut PC Pro Simulator

1. Access your TestOut site by choosing any TestOut assignment in your Canvas. 

2. Click on the menu symbol at the top of the page:
   - navigate to “8.5.1 Updates”. 
 
 3. Watch/read  the items on Windows Updates: 8.5.1 "Updates", 8.5.2 "Use Windows Update", 8.5.3 "Update Facts" (Scores for watching these videos do not appear on Canvas, but they ARE visible in the TestOut gradebook). 

4. After watching the items, continue to the TestOut lab, which is “8.5.4  Configure Windows Update”. 
    - Complete the lab successfully and BEFORE CLOSING THE FINISHED LAB:  Place a screenshot here showing your score report.
    - NOTE: Your score report must show the score, the contents of “Your Performance” and “Task Summary”, the time elapsed (at the top) AND the actual date/time in your computer’s taskbar in order to validate this as your own unique attempt.
    - Your screenshot should be between 4 and 5 inches tall, legible, and keep the aspect ratio (not stretched or distorted).

5.	For the grade for Part 2: Screenshot of your completed 8.5.4 lab exercise on TestOut, along with date and time from your computer system, Screenshot 4: place it with the label under “Deliverables”. 


# Deliverables

- The images should be properly cropped and like the sample in the instructions.
