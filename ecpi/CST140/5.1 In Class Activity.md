# Week 5 - Investigating Linux Ubuntu (Using VMWare)
## Part 1 – Install Ubuntu in VMware
**Important note: Remember that Linux commands are case-sensitive!**

1. In the VMware Workstation console create a new VM
   - Typical, from disc image file (iso) by browsing to the drive containing the ISO (likely D: or E:)
2. Select the iso for Ubuntu Linux and install.
3. For the machine username use your student ID (small letters and numbers) and an appropriate password.
4. Accept the defaults for disk capacity of 20 GB and split virtual disk into multiple files.
5. Power on the virtual machine and wait for initial configuration questions.
6. Select English keyboard layout and language.
7. For installation type, use the default of Erase disk and install Ubuntu (this is a VM and will not destroy the underlying host OS)
8. Verify location based on time zone.
9. On the “Who are you?” screen, enter your name, name the computer, and pick a username (your student id) and an appropriate password. This is the login information.
10. Wait for the installation to complete (about 5 minutes) and “Restart Now.”
    
## Part 2 – Basic Configuration
1. Once the Ubuntu VM reboots, login with your user credentials.
2. Skip through preliminary option screens, with the exception of Software Updater
3. Perform the Ubuntu Software update.
4. Change the background by right-clicking on the desktop, selecting “Change Background,” and picking a background different from the default background. Then close the background selection window.
5. On the left side of the screen are your “Favorites”
6. Remove from Favorites by right-clicking each and selecting “Remove from Favorites.

8. Click the <img width="67" height="63" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56013f78-3358-45c5-bd53-f3de57949a17" /> (grid icon) in the lower left corner to show applications.
9. Add LibreOffice Writer to Favorites by right-clicking on it and selecting “Add to Favorites.”
10. Add Terminal to Favorites.
11. Use the mouse to drag Terminal to the top of Favorites.
12. Return to the desktop by clicking on the desktop icon.
13. Take a screenshot of your new desktop layout. This will be “Screenshot 1” for your deliverables.
14. Caption it as **“Screenshot 1: Showing new background and list of modified Favorites.”**
    
## Part 3 Terminal
1. Open Terminal (This should now be at the top of your Favorites.)
2. Change the terminal colors to black letters on a white background.
   - This can be done by right-clicking on the terminal background and selecting the Colors tab.
   - Black is # 000000 and white is #FFFFFF
4. Enter the command ```ls``` for list directory (these are the small letters L and S).
5. Enter the command ```touch``` linuxiscool.txt to create the file “linuxiscool.txt”
6. Enter the command ```ls -l``` to list the directory in long format. You should see the file “linuxiscool.txt”
7. Enter the command ```mkdir ICanHandleLinux``` to make a directory in the current directory.
8. List the current directory to verify the newly created directory exists.
9. Change the computer name using the command ```sudo hostname ffflll-linux``` (substitute the six letters of your student ID for ffflll). You’ll need to enter your password since you’re invoking your administrative privileges.
10. Verify the new hostname by typing the command ```hostname```.
11. Take a screenshot of the terminal window. Be sure to include at least the last 25 lines. This will be “screenshot 2” of your deliverables. Caption it as **“Screenshot 2: Showing Linux Terminal commands and their output.”**
    
## Part 4 More terminal and Installing software.
1. Clear the terminal screen with the command ```clear```.
2. Install “tree” using the command ```sudo snap install tree```.
3. Enter the command ```tree``` to display the directory structure of your home directory.
4. After ```tree``` is successfully installed, run the ```tree``` command.
5. In the directory “Pictures,” create a directory called “Graduation.” You will need to use the ```cd``` and ```mkdir``` commands with the appropriate parameters.
6. Return to your home folder and run the ```tree``` command again. This should show your new “Graduation” directory under “Pictures.
7. Take a screenshot of the “tree” output. This will be “Screenshot 3.” Caption it as **“Screenshot 3: Showing the output of the tree command.”**
   
## Part 5. Installing and removing software.
1. Install the following software packages in your Linux VM using the ```apt install``` command.
2. You may need to invoke superuser privileges with sudo. If an installation hangs, you can abort it with CTRL-C
   - fortune-mod ```sudo apt install fortune-mod```
   - hello
   - cowsay
3. Run the following commands and observe the output.
   - ```hello```
   - ```fortune``` (run this one several times, you should receive a different output each time)
   - ```fortune | cowsay``` (piping the fortune to cowsay)
4. Capture a screenshot of at least 2 of the fortunes, including the one where it was piped to cowsay.
5. Caption it as **“Screenshot 4: Showing the fortunes.”**
6. Uninstall cowsay using the command ```sudo apt remove cowsay```.
7. You should observe the uninstallation of cowsay.
