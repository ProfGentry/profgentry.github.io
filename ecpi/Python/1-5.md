CYB 120 – Week 2 Assignment: Flow Control in Cybersecurity (Ch. 2)

Due: [Set date/time]
Weight: Counts toward “Assignments & Labs” (40% category)
Est. Time: 2–4 hours

1) Goal

Use conditional statements, loops, and Boolean logic to create scripts that demonstrate security-relevant workflows.

2) Deliverables

Create a folder:

CYB120_Wk2_FlowControl_Lastname_Firstname/


Include:

lockout_counter.py

password_policy_loop.py

bruteforce_timer.py

menu_driven_tool.py

README.md (instructions + sample runs)

3) Tasks
A) Lockout Counter (5 pts)

File: lockout_counter.py

Prompt for username & password.

Allow 5 attempts max (instead of 3).

On each failure, print attempts remaining.

If locked, display:

Account locked. Too many failed attempts.


Concepts: while loop, counters, if/else.

B) Password Policy Loop (5 pts)

File: password_policy_loop.py

Continuously prompt the user for a password until they meet these minimum requirements:

At least 8 characters

Must contain the word "Cyber" (case-sensitive)

When valid, print:

Password accepted.


Concepts: while True loop, len(), in keyword, break.

C) Brute Force Timer (5 pts)

File: bruteforce_timer.py

Ask user for password length (int).

Use while or for loop to simulate guesses until reaching the total number of possibilities.

Use Boolean logic to stop if a guessed password equals "target".

Print:

Simulated X guesses before success.


Concepts: for loop, if condition, counters, stopping early with break.
(Hint: Keep “target” fixed like "aaa" so it doesn’t take forever — this is a toy simulation.)

D) Menu-Driven Tool (5 pts)

File: menu_driven_tool.py
Create a simple menu loop that runs until the user chooses Exit:

Cybersecurity Utility
1. Check if a number is even/odd
2. Count down from 10
3. Print a system access warning
4. Exit
Enter choice: 


If 1: prompt for a number, print Even/ Odd.

If 2: use a for loop to count down from 10 to 1.

If 3: print

*** WARNING: Authorized Users Only ***


If 4: break the loop.

Concepts: while True, if/elif/else, for loop inside menu.
