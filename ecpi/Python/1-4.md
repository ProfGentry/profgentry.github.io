Part A: Predict the Output (if/elif/else)

For each snippet, write what will print before testing in Python.

x = 7
if x > 10:
    print("Big")
elif x == 7:
    print("Lucky")
else:
    print("Small")

y = -3
if y > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Non-positive")

Part B: Fill-in-the-Blank (Flow Control Keywords)

The statement used for decision-making in Python is ________.

A loop that repeats while a condition is true is called a ________ loop.

To stop a loop immediately, use the ________ statement.

To skip the rest of a loop iteration and move to the next, use ________.

Part C: Debug the Code

The following program should count down from 5 to 1, but it doesn’t work correctly.
Find and fix at least two errors.

count = 5
while count = 0:
print(count)
count = count - 1
print("Blastoff!")

Part D: Mini Coding Challenge – Login Attempts

Write pseudocode (or short Python code) for this scenario:

The user has 3 attempts to type the password "Cyber123".

If correct, print Access Granted. and stop.

If wrong 3 times, print Account Locked.

Part E: Reflection (Short Answer)

Why is flow control important in cybersecurity scripts?
(Hint: think about logins, password policies, or scanning loops.)
