# 1.6 Assignment: Flow Control in Cybersecurity
## Deliverables
Include the below script files:
```
lockout_counter.py
password_policy_loop.py
bruteforce_timer.py
menu_driven_tool.py
```

## Task A Lockout Counter

File: ```lockout_counter.py```

- Prompt for username & password.
- Allow 5 attempts max (instead of 3).
- On each failure, print attempts remaining.
- If locked, display:
```
Account locked. Too many failed attempts.
```

## Task B Password Policy Loop

File: ```password_policy_loop.py```

- Continuously prompt the user for a password until they meet these minimum requirements:
  - At least 8 characters
  - Must contain the word ```"Cyber"``` (case-sensitive)
- When valid, print:
```
Password accepted.
```

## Task C Brute Force Timer

File: ```bruteforce_timer.py```

- Ask user for **password length** (int).
- Use ```while``` or ```for``` loop to **simulate guesses** until reaching the total number of possibilities.
- Use **Boolean logic** to stop if a guessed password equals ```"target"```.
- Print:
```
Simulated X guesses before success.
```
(Hint: Keep “target” fixed like "aaa" so it doesn’t take forever — this is a toy simulation.)

## Task D Menu-Driven Tool

File: ```menu_driven_tool.py```
Create a **simple menu** loop that runs until the user chooses Exit:
```
Cybersecurity Utility
1. Check if a number is even/odd
2. Count down from 10
3. Print a system access warning
4. Exit
Enter choice: 
```

- If ```1```: prompt for a number, print Even/ Odd.
- If ```2```: use a ```for``` loop to count down from 10 to 1.
- If ```3```: print
```
*** WARNING: Authorized Users Only ***
```
- If ```4```: break the loop.
