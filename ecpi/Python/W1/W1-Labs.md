# Week 1 - Labs
## Lab 1 – Python Setup & Hello World

### Objectives: Verify Python installation.

Run Python interactively and with .py files.

### Tasks:

- Open Python in interactive mode. Type:
```print("Hello, Cybersecurity!")```
- Save a file called ```hello.py``` with the same line. 
- Run it from the terminal with:
```python hello.py```
- Modify the file to print your name and today’s date.

Example:
```python
Hello, Jennifer! Today is 9/5/2025.
```
### Deliverable: 
```hello.py```

## Lab 2 – Expressions & Math Practice

### Objectives:
Practice arithmetic operators, variables, and printing results.

### Tasks:
- In a file ```expressionsLab.py```, write code to calculate and print:
  - Area of a rectangle (length = 10, width = 5).
  - Area of a circle (radius = 7, use 3.14 * r ** 2).
  - Result of 22 / 7 vs. 22 // 7.
- Create two variables:
  -  hours = 40
  -  rate = 15.25.
- Calculate and print weekly pay: hours * rate.
- Add comments to explain each calculation.

### Deliverable: 
```expressionsLab.py```

## Lab 3 – Greeting & User Input
### Objectives:
Work with input() and string concatenation.
### Tasks:
- Create ```greetingLab.py```.
- Ask for the user’s name and favorite color.
  
- Print:
```python
Hello <name>! Your favorite color is <color>.
```

- Ask for the user’s age.
  
- Print:
  
```python
In 5 years, you will be <age+5>.
```

- Test with at least 2 different sets of inputs.

### Deliverable: 
```greetingLab.py```

## Lab 4 – First Access Control with Conditionals
### Objectives:
Practice if/else statements and basic input validation.
### Tasks:
- Create ```accessLab.py.```

- Store one valid username and password in variables:
  - validUser = "student"
  - validPassword = "Passw0rd!"
- Ask the user for their username and password.
- If both match → print: ```Access Granted.```
- Else → print: ```Access Denied.```

- Add a bonus feature: if the user types admin as the username but wrong password, print:

```Warning: Admin access attempt failed!```

### Deliverable: 
```accessLab.py```
