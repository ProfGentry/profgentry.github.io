# 1.3 Python Basics for Cybersecurity
### Deliverables (submit all four)
Create a folder:
- CYB120_Wk1_CyberBasics_Lastname_Firstname/
  
Include these files:
- ```banner_ack.py```
- ```access_gate.py```
- ```password_brief.py```
- ```bruteforce_math.py```

## Task A — Security Banner & AUP Acknowledgment (5 pts)

File: ```banner_ack.py```

Write a script that:

- Prints a system use notice (two lines).
- Asks the user to type ```I AGREE``` (exact text).
  - If they type I AGREE, print ```Access to login prompt allowed.```
  - Else print ```Access denied. Please contact your administrator.```

### Example
```
*** Authorized Use Only ***
Use of this system may be monitored.

Type I AGREE to continue: I AGREE
Access to login prompt allowed.
```
## Task B — Role-Based Access Gate (8 pts)

File: ```access_gate.py```

- Write a single-user access check (no dicts yet):
- Store these constants at the top:

```
ALLOWED_USER = "student"
ALLOWED_PASS = "Passw0rd!"
```
- Ask for **username** and **password**.
- If both match display ```Access Granted: student.```
- Otherwise display ```Access Denied.```
- Add a **3-attempt** limit. After three failures, print ```Account locked.``` and stop.
- If the username entered is ```"admin"``` but the password is wrong, print an **extra warning** line:
```
Warning: Admin access attempt failed!
```

### Example (fail, fail, lock)
```
Username: admin
Password: 123
Access Denied.
Warning: Admin access attempt failed!
Username: student
Password: wrong
Access Denied.
Username: root
Password: anything
Account locked.
```

## Task C — Password Policy Brief (4 pts)

File: ```password_brief.py```

- Create a script that gives **basic feedback** on a password **without** advanced checks:
- Prompt for a proposed password (plain ```input()``` is fine for Week 1).
- Print **Strong** if **length ≥ 8**; otherwise **Weak.**
- Also print a brief reason line:
  - If ```< 8```: ```Reason: too short (minimum 8).```
  - If ```≥ 8```: ```Reason: meets minimum length.```

### Example
```
Enter a password to evaluate: cyber
Strength: Weak
Reason: too short (minimum 8).
```

## Task D — Brute-Force Math (3 pts)

File: ```bruteforce_math.py```

- Show simple **risk math** with expressions and variables:
- Ask the user for **password length** (integer).
- Assume **26 lowercase letters only**; total combinations = ```26 ** length.```
- Print the total combinations and an **estimated seconds** to try them all at a rate of **100,000 guesses/sec** (as a rough idea).
- Also print the **approximate hours** (seconds / 3600) rounded **down** using integer division ```//```.

### Example
```
Enter password length (lowercase only): 6
Total combinations: 308915776
Time @100k guesses/sec: 3089.15776 seconds
Approx hours (integer): 0
```
