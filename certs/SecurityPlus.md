# CompTIA Security+ SYO-701 Exam Tips & Tricks
## A Good Study Method
- Take practice tests of what you know and then proceed to what you are struggling with.
- I started watching Professfor Messer's vids again but this time I was only listening and I printed out all the objectives and highlighting what I needed more focus on.
- If you need it more examples, I would watch ITProtv sec+ course with Wes Bryan.
 - Also download the CompTIA Security+ Exam Prep by Thanh Hung, the thing that I love the most about it is that you have to re read and analyze what is being asked. Very close to exam IMO

- When taking practice exams, I would aim for 75%-85% on the first try.

- On the two weeks before the exam I suyggest locking in and studying as long as possible.
- Re-take all Messer's tests
- For PBQs practice I recommend Messer's questions, but if you want to go thru similar like real exam scenarios you can visit CyberKraft videos.

## Study Schedule
- Spend 2-3 hours studying on weekdays, on weekend I would spend 3-5 hours.
